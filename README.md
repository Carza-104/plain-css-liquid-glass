Quick and simple Liquid Glass material in plain CSS. Couldn’t find a way to replicate the background distortion around the edges, everything else was recreated based on Apple’s Figma template though. Might implement this into apple-svelte.
Switching between light and dark theme makes the Liquid Glass background behave differently.
